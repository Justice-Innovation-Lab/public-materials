This repository catalogs code that Justice Innovation Lab intends to make public. While not all code that Justice Innovation Lab makes public will be housed here, code and data for Justice Innovation Lab public reports as well as other code for applications that we build will be made available here, to the extent possible. Currently, folders are designated for the Lab's jurisdiction partners within which code and data for that partner that can be made public, is published.

Our goal is to be as transparent as possible regarding our analysis work and we welcome outside review. Given the sensitivity of the data that we work with and legal regulations regarding sharing that data, often it will not be possible to share the actual data that formed the basis of our reports. While we would like to make some subset of the data available or to sufficiently deidenitify the data for sharing, such standards must be weighed against the risk of identification and the burden on our staff to properly deidentify the data. If you are interested in recreating our analysis and need access to the data, please contact us with your proposal and we will work to provide you with the data.
